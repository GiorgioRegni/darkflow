## What DarkFlow is not

 - DarkFlow is not a program that requires you to manage intermediate renderings or temporary files.
 - DarkFlow is not an image editor that modifies your images.
 - DarkFlow is not a Raster Graphics Editor with brushes nor a freehand drawing tool.


## What DarkFlow aims to be

 - DarkFlow is about creating pipelines of image processing operators.
 - DarkFlow creates new images from your original photos by applying operators during the process.
 - DarkFlow applies global and reproducible operations on images.

## What DarkFlow looks like?

DarkFlow looks like an interactive diagram editor until you open a visualization window. Here is the processing with DarkFlow of the Messier 8 region from very good LRGB source images. [Image Acquisition by Jim Misti](http://www.mistisoftware.com/astronomy/index_fits.htm).

*Don't pay attention to the jerks and jolts as they are caused by the screencast program and the small resolution used for acquisition purpose.*

## Project oriented

### Non destructive approach

### Project artifacts

## Efficient

### parallelism

with OpenMP or Grand Central Dispatch

### 16-bit Pixels formats

16-bit except for operators involving multiples images

#### Linear

#### Non-Linear

#### HDR
