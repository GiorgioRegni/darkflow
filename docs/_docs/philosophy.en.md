## What DarkFlow is not

 - DarkFlow is not a program that requires you to manage intermediate renderings or temporary files.
 - DarkFlow is not an image editor that modifies your images.
 - DarkFlow is not a Raster Graphics Editor with brushes nor a freehand drawing tool.


## What DarkFlow aims to be

 - DarkFlow is about creating pipelines of image processing operators.
 - DarkFlow creates new images from your original photos by applying operators during the process.
 - DarkFlow applies global and reproducible operations on images.

## What DarkFlow looks like?
