DarkFlow looks like an interactive diagram editor until you open a visualization window. Here is the processing with DarkFlow of the Messier 8 region from very good LRGB source images. [Image Acquisition by Jim Misti](http://www.mistisoftware.com/astronomy/index_fits.htm).

*Don't pay attention to the jerks and jolts as they are caused by the screencast program and the small resolution used for acquisition purpose.*

## What DarkFlow aims to be

 - DarkFlow aims to be an all in one comprehensive solution for astrophotography processing.
 - DarkFlow aims to offer fundamental operators that let you craft methods we never envisionned.
 - DarkFlow aims to be intuitive and easy to use. It tries to not disturb your flow of ideas.

## What DarkFlow is

 - DarkFlow is about creating pipelines of image processing operators.
 - DarkFlow creates new images from your original photos by applying operators during the process.
 - DarkFlow applies global and reproducible operations on images.

## What DarkFlow is not

 - DarkFlow is not a program that requires you to manage intermediate renderings or temporary files.
 - DarkFlow is not an image editor that modifies your images.
 - DarkFlow is not a Raster Graphics Editor with brushes nor a freehand drawing tool.

## DarkFlow is Project oriented

You are encouraged to work iteratively on the processing of your images. Save the project, and return to it once your eyes are rested. Things are better built gradually.

You can even use [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) (in association with [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to store your raw photos) to track all the versions of your image processing project and host it for free on [GitHUB](https://github.com). Take a look at the [NGC7023](https://github.com/ploki/NGC7023) repository.

### Non destructive approach

### Project artifacts

## Efficient

### parallelism

with OpenMP or Grand Central Dispatch

### 16-bit Pixels formats

16-bit except for operators involving multiples images

#### Linear

#### Non-Linear

#### HDR
